# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## Introduction

This project is the final assignment for the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course on Coursera.  
It demonstrates the ability to collect, clean, and produce a tidy data set that can be used for later analysis.

## Files Included

- `run_analysis.R`: Script that downloads, reads, merges, processes, and outputs the tidy dataset.
- `CodeBook.md`: A code book that describes each variable, the data, and the transformations applied.
- `tidy_data.txt`: Final tidy dataset containing the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
- `README.md`: This file, describing the project structure and logic.

## Project Summary

The script `run_analysis.R`:
1. Downloads and unzips the dataset.
2. Merges the training and test datasets into a single dataset.
3. Extracts measurements related to the mean and standard deviation.
4. Replaces activity codes with descriptive activity names.
5. Labels the dataset with descriptive variable names.
6. Creates a second tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
7. Writes the tidy data set to `tidy_data.txt`.
